# UOW-Room-Booking-System
IT Project Management Project

This project aims to create a working prototype for a room booking system for UOW. 

The group is contracted by the CIO of UOW to develop a room booking system for UOW staff and
students. As a minimum requirement, the system should provide the following functions:

- Room creation and management : only done by a staff user, he/she can create and launch (make
available for reservations of a newly created room), or adjust the price (each booking is
chargeable), date/time, promotional codes, capacities of room.

- Room booking : only done by a student user, he/she can view the list of room, make a booking of
one or more rooms, and modify or cancel an existing booking.
